<h1 align="center">Team Fortress 2 Team Radar</h1>

The TF2 Team Radar plugin creates a simple, real-time radar display for each player, showing the positions of their teammates relative to their own position. 

The radar uses SourceMod's HUD text functionality for rendering, making it a lightweight solution that doesn't require any client-side modifications.

> [!NOTE]
> **This plugin primarily shows teammates** and was originally designed for team coordination and awareness in a practicing environment (Comp coaching/scrims). **It does not provide information about enemy positions, except for disguised Spies when enabled by admins.**

## Features

1. **Radar Display**:
   - Shows teammates as colored dots
     - Green: Above 50% health
     - Red: 50% health or below
   - Represents the player as a yellow up-facing arrow (â–²) in the center
   - Radar is toggleable and it's position is adjustable, settings are saved per player
   - Everything neatly packed under a `!radar` or `sm_radar` command

2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Radar updates at regular intervals (customizable through config file)
   - Calculates and displays relative positions of all teammates
   - Rotates based on player's view angle, to mimic a normal radar

3. **Range Limitation**:
   - Only teammates within a certain range are displayed (customizable through config file)

4. **Pinging System**:
   - Players can mark locations on the radar for their teammates
   - Use `!mapping` or `sm_mapping` to ping (tip: `bind <key> "say /mapping"`)
   - Pings appear as yellow exclamation marks (!) on the radar
   - Pings last for 5 seconds with a 3-second cooldown

5. **Admin Features**:
   - Toggle visibility of disguised enemy Spies globally on the radar
   - Reload radar configuration on-the-fly with `!reloadradar` or through the radar menu
