<h1 align="center">TF2 Team Radar</h1>

The TF2 Team Radar plugin creates a simple, real-time radar display for each player, showing the positions of their teammates relative to their own position. 

The radar uses SourceMod's HUD text functionality to render the dots, making it a lightweight solution that doesn't require any client-side modifications.

Note: This radar only shows teammates and is designed for team coordination and awareness in a practicing environment (Comp coaching/scrims). It does not provide any information about enemy positions.

<details>
<summary>â€ŽHere's a breakdown of its functionality:</summary>

1. **Initialization**: When a player connects, the radar is automatically enabled for them.

2. **Regular Updates**: The plugin updates the radar display at regular intervals (default: every 0.1 seconds).

3. **Player Position Calculation**: For each update, the plugin:
   - Gets the position and angle of the player
   - Calculates the relative positions of all teammates

4. **Radar Display**: The plugin then:
   - Creates a radar background in the top-left corner of the screen
   - Represents each teammate as a dot on this radar

5. **Rotation**: The radar rotates based on the player's view angle, ensuring that "up" on the radar always corresponds to the direction the player is facing.

6. **Range Limitation**: Only teammates within a certain range (default: 2560 game units) are displayed on the radar.
